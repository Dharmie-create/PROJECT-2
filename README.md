Customer Data Project 2
# Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service 

## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to understand customer behaviour, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancelations and renewals by analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to  gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data. More so, we are able to figure out what is working, what is not working and what should be focused on.
